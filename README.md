# Robotic Car Maze Solver

### Tr√©maux's algorithm implementation on script that controls autonomous self-driving robotic vehicle.

The robotic car is equipped with three Ultrasonic Sensors HC-SR04 each measuring distance left,right and in front of the car.
The script controls the vehicle in such way that it always follows the wall on its left until it escapes the maze.
